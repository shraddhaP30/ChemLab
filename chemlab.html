        However, the department has plans to expand the scope to the following</p>
        <ul style="font-size: large;">
            <li>ElectroChemistry, Nonconventional Energy and Corrosin Science Lab</li>
            <li>Bio-Inorganic Chemistry Lab</li>
            <li>Synthetic Organic Chemistry Lab.</li>
            <li>Molecular Recognition Lab.</li>
            <li>Natural Product Chemistry Lab.
